# Rolnick Lab Montr√©al Guide

We use TypeScript and React for the implementation. The project was setup using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## System requirements

- Node
- NPM

The `.nvmrc` file in project root describes the recommended Node version for this project.

## Getting started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run app in development mode
npm run dev
```

The app will now be available in a browser on http://localhost:5173/. Hot reload will be enabled by default.
